## üìå Project Overview

Thousands of people, especially children, go missing every day in India. Despite efforts from NGOs and government initiatives, timely recovery remains a challenge.  
Traditional investigative methods, while effective, can be slow and resource-intensive.  

This project introduces an **AI-assisted platform** designed to expedite the process of locating missing individuals by:

- Leveraging advanced facial recognition using **MediaPipe Face Mesh**.  
- Enabling rapid scanning of large volumes of images (e.g., CCTV, public submissions).  
- Providing accessible web and mobile interfaces for authorities and the public.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Seamless Registration**  
  Register new missing person cases, including image uploads with automated facial feature extraction.  

- **Efficient Matching**  
  Match submitted images against the database using face mesh data, reducing manual review burden.  

- **Multi-User Dashboards**  
  Admin and user interfaces for managing, updating, and monitoring cases.  

- **Public Engagement**  
  Mobile and web submission portals for sighting reports.  

- **Lightweight & Portable**  
  All data is stored in SQLite; ready-to-run with minimal setup.
